# How to solve

How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method by George Polya (English)

## Understand the problem
Restate the problem in your own words.
What are the inputs that go into the problem?
What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Break it down
Excipitly write down all the steps you need to take. // comments

## Solve or simplify
Solve the problem following comments.
If it is difficult to solve, solve a simplified version to get marks.
- temporary ignore the difficulty
- write simplified solution
- then incorporate the difficulty back in

## Look back and refactor
Can you check the results?
Can you derive the results differently?
Can you understand it at a glance?
Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
Can you improve the performance of your solution?
Can you think of other ways to refactor?
